Revision history for Hessian::Client



0.1.6 Thu Mar 27 2009
        Revised Hessian version 2 serialization/deserialization to conform to
        http://hessian.caucho.com/doc/hessian-ws.html.  

0.1.6 Thu Mar 16 2009
        Added logic to check the length to read from the handle against the
        remaining length of the string.  If the remaining string is too short,
        the translator now throws a MessageIncomplete::X.  This is mainly for
        integration into a POE filter. If the message is incomplete then the
        internal buffer should return to some initial position and wait for
        the next call to process_message.
