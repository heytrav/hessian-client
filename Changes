Revision history for Hessian::Client


0.1.14 Sun Apr 19 2009
        Trying out a new way to get the proper integer out on 64 bit int
        machines

0.1.13 Sun Apr 19 2009
        Want to see if the integer problems I'm having are due to endian-ness
        of different platforms. Maybe having the error from the test display
        the value for the particular platform might help.

0.1.12 Sat Apr 4 2009
        Trying to debug some of the platform dependent problems that seem to
        be coming up.  Most of the CPAN Testers reports I've been getting say
        that a lot of the numerical deserialization methods fail.  Don't know
        if I'll find a fix for this in the near future, so for now I'm just
        going to throw an exception.

0.1.9 Sun Mar 28 2009
        Fixed a problem with untyped arrays in which the "length" bit was
        clashing with the "End of datastructure" symbol (z).


0.1.8 Sat Mar 27 2009
        Revised Hessian version 2 serialization/deserialization to conform to
        http://hessian.caucho.com/doc/hessian-ws.html.  

0.1.6 Thu Mar 16 2009
        Added logic to check the length to read from the handle against the
        remaining length of the string.  If the remaining string is too short,
        the translator now throws a MessageIncomplete::X.  This is mainly for
        integration into a POE filter. If the message is incomplete then the
        internal buffer should return to some initial position and wait for
        the next call to process_message.  
        

0.1.5 Thu Mar 12 2009
        Completely rewrote version 2 serialization/deserilization modules to
        conform to http://www.caucho.com/resin-3.1/doc/hessian-2.0-spec.xtp.

0.1.4 Sun Feb 08 2009
        Throw an exception for any Hessian Fault received from service.
        Serialization for objects
