Hessian - Base of the Hessian protocol.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Hessian version 0.0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Hessian;

  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Totally experimental.  I'll put more in here when I have a better idea how
this will work.


=head1 INTERFACE 

No real implementation here.  See modules under C<~/Hessian> directory.




=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Hard to say. Looking for some mechanism to deal with Perl's weak typing.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
    with. This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or
    competition for system or program resources, or due to internal
    limitations of Perl (for example, many modules that use source code
    filters are mutually incompatible).

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=for author to fill in:
    A list of known problems with the module, together with some
    indication Whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming
    release. Also a list of restrictions on the features the module
    does provide: data types that cannot be handled, performance issues
    and the circumstances in which they may arise, practical
    limitations on the size of data sets, special cases that are not
    (yet) handled, etc.

No bugs have been reported.
